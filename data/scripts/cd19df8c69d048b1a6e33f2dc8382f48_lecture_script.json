      "narration": "Today we’re building intuition for where continuous-time models, like geometric Brownian motion and Black–Scholes, actually come from. The key idea is simple: if you take a discrete-time stock model and make the time steps smaller and smaller—so trading happens in more and more frequent ‘ticks’—then the distribution of returns starts to look Gaussian, and prices become log-normal.\n\nWe’ll do this in two stages. First, we’ll work under the real-world probability measure, often called P, and show that as the inter-tick time shrinks, log prices converge to a normal distribution. Then we’ll switch to the risk-neutral or martingale measure, Q, where the drift changes to match no-arbitrage pricing. Finally, we’ll see how that log-normal risk-neutral distribution gives the Black–Scholes call price.\n\nThe point is not just to memorize formulas. It’s to understand the bridge: a recombining binomial-style model with very small steps becomes the continuous-time model you already know.\n\n[Pause for five seconds]",

      "narration": "Let’s specify the discrete model carefully. Time advances in increments of delta t—this is our inter-tick time. We’ll treat delta t as small, and later we’ll imagine it going to zero.\n\nThere are three key constants in the stock dynamics: mu, the stock’s growth rate under the real-world measure; sigma, the volatility or noise intensity; and r, the continuously compounded risk-free rate.\n\nThe riskless asset is a cash bond that grows deterministically. In continuous compounding, it’s just exponential growth at rate r.\n\nNow for the stock. At each tick, starting from a current price s, the next price is s multiplied by an exponential factor. There’s a deterministic piece, mu times delta t, plus a random shock that is either plus sigma times square-root delta t, or minus sigma times square-root delta t.\n\nTwo things are doing heavy lifting here. First, the shock scales like square-root delta t, which is exactly the scaling that makes variance grow proportionally to time in the limit. Second, the shocks are symmetric—an up move and a down move of equal magnitude in the exponent—so the tree recombines nicely.\n\nUnder the physical measure P, the simplest case assumes up and down are equally likely: probability one-half each.\n\n[Pause for five seconds]",

      "narration": "Now we fix a time horizon t—say one year—and we ask what happens when delta t becomes very small. If each tick is delta t, then the number of ticks in horizon t is n equals t over delta t.\n\nOver those n ticks, the stock experiences a sequence of up and down shocks. Let X sub n be the number of up moves. Under P, X sub n is binomial with n trials and success probability one-half.\n\nThe clever step is to rewrite the terminal stock price in terms of X sub n. Every up move contributes plus sigma square-root delta t in the exponent; every down move contributes minus sigma square-root delta t. So the net random contribution depends on how many more ups than downs you got, which is two X sub n minus n.\n\nWhen you normalize that net count by square-root n, you get a quantity with mean zero and variance one. And that’s exactly the setup for the Central Limit Theorem: as n goes to infinity, that normalized variable converges in distribution to a standard normal.\n\nOnce you plug that back into the expression for the stock price, you see that log S sub t becomes approximately normal, with mean log S sub zero plus mu times t, and variance sigma squared times t. That means S sub t is approximately log-normal.\n\nSo even before we talk about no-arbitrage or risk-neutral measures, the discrete model already explains why log-normal marginals are a natural outcome of many small multiplicative shocks.\n\n[Pause for five seconds]",

But for pricing, we need the no-arbitrage measure Q—the one under which discounted asset prices are martingales.\n\nIn a one-step binomial model, switching to Q means changing the up probability from one-half to some q chosen so that the expected next stock price, discounted by the bond growth, matches today’s price.\n\nConcretely, we pick q so that the current price equals the discounted expected next price. When you solve that equation, you get an explicit formula for q in terms of the up and down multipliers and the risk-free rate.\n\nWhen delta t is small, q is close to one-half, but shifted slightly. The size of the shift is proportional to square-root delta t, and the direction depends on how the physical drift compares to the risk-free rate, with the usual volatility scaling.\n\nUnder Q, the number of up moves X sub n is still binomial, but now with success probability q. That changes the mean of the normalized statistic, while the variance still approaches one in the limit.\n\nApplying the Central Limit Theorem again, the normalized net-up-moves converges to a normal variable, but now with a nonzero mean. When you plug this into the expression for S sub t, the drift becomes the risk-neutral one.\n\nThe final continuous-time-looking representation is the familiar one: S sub t equals S sub zero times an exponential of a Gaussian term sigma square-root t times Z, plus a deterministic term involving r minus one-half sigma squared.\n\nThis is exactly the marginal distribution implied by geometric Brownian motion under Q, and it is the distribution used in Black–Scholes pricing.\n\n[Pause for five seconds]",

We then switched to the martingale measure Q by choosing a risk-neutral up probability q so discounted stock prices are martingales; in the same limit this produces the familiar risk-neutral log-normal form with drift r minus one-half sigma squared.
