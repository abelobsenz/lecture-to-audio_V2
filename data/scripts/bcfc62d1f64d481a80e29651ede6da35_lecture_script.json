      "narration": "Today we study how VIX options and standard European options behave when maturity becomes very small, in a model that combines local-stochastic volatility with compound-Poisson jumps.\n\nThe practical motivation is straightforward: short-dated options are extremely sensitive to rare events. If you ignore jumps, you often severely underprice out-of-the-money options close to expiry. The paper’s goal is to make that statement precise, and to provide explicit leading-order formulas you can compute in closed form for several jump-size models.\n\nWe’ll begin by fixing the financial objects. First, VIX is defined under the risk-neutral measure as a particular conditional expectation of future log-returns over a window of length tau. Then VIX calls and puts are just standard European-style payoffs written on the random variable VIX at option maturity T.\n\nThe overall asymptotic regime is: option maturity T goes to zero. Often, we also let the VIX averaging window tau go to zero to obtain a tractable proxy for VIX itself. A key theme will be that the order of magnitude differs dramatically between out-of-the-money and at-the-money payoffs.\n\nWe’ll set up the baseline local-stochastic volatility diffusion first, and then extend it to jumps. In the next chapter we’ll see how the VIX definition simplifies, and where the jump correction constant kappa comes from.\n\nPause for five seconds.",

      "narration": "Now we extend the diffusion to include three jump channels: idiosyncratic jumps in the asset, idiosyncratic jumps in variance, and common jumps that move both simultaneously.\n\nEach jump channel is compound Poisson: arrivals are Poisson with intensity lambda, and jump sizes are random. The asset jumps are modeled multiplicatively, so a jump of size Y changes S by a factor e to the Y. The same multiplicative idea is used for V to preserve positivity.\n\nA crucial step in the paper is simplifying the VIX definition when the VIX averaging window tau is small. In that regime, the time-average of the instantaneous variance term collapses to the instantaneous value at time T. But the jump part does not vanish; it leaves behind a constant adjustment called kappa.\n\nSo in the small-tau limit, VIX squared behaves like eta of S at T squared times V at T, plus kappa. This is powerful because it reduces the VIX, which is defined via a conditional expectation over a future window, to an almost-European function of the state variables at time T.\n\nThe paper then provides error bounds showing that replacing VIX by the square root of this proxy is controlled, with errors going to zero as tau goes to zero under regularity assumptions.\n\nThis sets up the next chapter: once VIX is approximated as a European-style payoff on the state at time T, we can do short-maturity asymptotics in T and isolate what comes from diffusion and what comes from jumps.\n\nPause for five seconds.",

      "name": "3) Universal short-maturity behavior: OTM is linear in T, ATM is square-root in T",
      "narration": "We now get to the headline asymptotic message.\n\nFor out-of-the-money options as maturity T goes to zero, the leading contribution comes from the event that exactly one jump occurs. The probability of one Poisson jump in a short interval is proportional to T, so the option price scales like T. The diffusion part would require an atypically large Gaussian move to cross the strike in vanishing time, which is exponentially unlikely, so it does not appear at leading order.\n\nFor at-the-money options, the story flips. A small Gaussian fluctuation is enough to generate a nontrivial payoff, and typical diffusion fluctuations are of size square root of T. So ATM option prices scale like square root of T. Jump events are still only order T, which is smaller than square root of T for small T, so jumps are negligible at the leading ATM order.\n\nThe paper formalizes this for both VIX options and standard European options. For OTM VIX options, the leading coefficient is a sum of three terms—one from idiosyncratic S jumps, one from common jumps, and one from idiosyncratic V jumps—each an integral of the payoff evaluated after a single jump, weighted by the corresponding intensity.\n\nFor OTM European options on S, only S-moving jumps matter at leading order, so you see idiosyncratic S jumps and common jumps, but not idiosyncratic V jumps.\n\nThen, for ATM results, we get explicit closed-form prefactors: for European options, it’s the local instantaneous volatility eta of S zero times square root of V zero divided by square root of two pi; for ATM VIX options, a more complex prefactor appears involving derivatives and correlation.\n\nIn the next chapter we’ll see how these general formulas become explicit numbers under concrete jump-size models like Eraker’s SVCJ and the Kou-type double-exponential model.\n\nPause for five seconds.",

      "narration": "General integral formulas are useful, but practitioners want parameters and closed forms. The paper therefore studies several jump-size specifications and computes the leading OTM coefficients explicitly.\n\nFirst is the Eraker-style SVCJ model: idiosyncratic log-price jumps are Gaussian, variance jumps are exponential and strictly positive, and common jumps have an exponential variance component with a conditionally Gaussian asset component whose mean depends on the variance jump. This structure captures the empirically observed pattern: volatility jumps upward, and the asset tends to jump downward at the same time through a negative dependence parameter.\n\nSecond is a Kou-type model: conditional on the variance common jump, the asset common jump is double-exponential, giving asymmetric heavy tails with different decay rates.\n\nThird is a folded-normal specification for the common variance jump: take the absolute value of a normal variable so the variance jump is positive, and keep the asset conditional jump Gaussian.\n\nA particularly sharp implication appears across these models: if variance jumps are strictly positive, then an out-of-the-money VIX put—meaning the strike is below the current VIX proxy—cannot be brought into the money by a single variance jump. So its OTM short-maturity coefficient is zero; the remaining diffusion-driven price is much smaller than order T.\n\nIn contrast, OTM VIX calls remain order T and are largely driven by variance jumps and common jumps.\n\nNext, we’ll look at the numerical experiments that compare these asymptotic coefficients to Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nPause for five seconds.",

Because OTM jump-driven prices are order T, the paper rescales prices by dividing by lambda C times T, and often multiplies by 1000 to display readable numbers. Under this rescaling, the asymptotic theory predicts a curve that should match the Monte Carlo points as T becomes small.\n\nFor European options in the Eraker and Kou-type models, the rescaled Monte Carlo points line up well with the asymptotic curve away from at-the-money. Near ATM, discrepancies are expected because the diffusion-driven square-root-of-T term is not captured by the OTM linear-in-T asymptotic.\n\nFor VIX calls, the agreement is particularly strong in the out-of-the-money region. The plots show a steep decay as the strike rises above the ATM VIX level, and the Monte Carlo points track the predicted curve.\n\nAcross models, the same qualitative message appears: the short-maturity OTM behavior is governed by single jumps and scales like T; the ATM behavior is diffusion-driven and scales like square root of T; and the quality of approximation improves as maturity decreases.\n\nPause for five seconds.",
